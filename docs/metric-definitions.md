# Metric Definitions

## Client Metrics

### Active Client
A client whose status is active in SimplePractice (not discharged).

### Discharged Client (Churned)

### Churn Rate

## Session Metrics

### Completed Sessions
The number of counted sessions completed for the time frame selected. Note, days and weeks are based on your preferred calendar configuration set in onboarding.

### Client Utilization
The percentage of a clinician's client capacity that is currently filled. This measures how close a clinician is to their maximum caseload.

**Formula:** Active Clients ÷ Client Goal × 100

**Example:** A clinician has a goal of 25 clients and currently has 10 active clients → Client Utilization = 10/25 = 40%

### Session Utilization
The percentage of completed sessions out of the clinician's session goal for that time frame. This measures how much of their session capacity a clinician is achieving.

**Formula:** Completed Sessions ÷ Session Goal × 100

**Example:** A clinician has a monthly goal of 90 sessions and completes 60 → Session Utilization = 60/90 = 66.7%

### Average Weekly Sessions
The total counted sessions in that time frame divided by the total number of weeks in that time frame. Note, weeks are based on your preferred calendar configuration set in onboarding.

### Clients Seen
The number of clients that have had a counted session during this time frame.

## Attendance Metrics

### Rebook Rate
Of the active clients, this is the percentage that have their next appointment scheduled.

### Show Rate
The percentage of sessions that were completed out of total booked sessions.

### Client Cancel Rate
The percentage of booked sessions that were canceled by the client.

### Clinician Cancel Rate
The percentage of booked sessions that were canceled by the clinician.

### Non-Billable Cancel Rate
Client cancellations + clinician cancellations as a percentage of all bookings.

### Late Cancel
A cancellation made within the defined late cancellation window (self-evident based on practice policy).

### No-Show
Client did not attend the session without canceling (self-evident).

## Retention Metrics

### Retention Rate
This is the percentage of clients with an intake during the time frame that stayed for 8 or more billable sessions. Note, retention is a metric that requires a longer time frame to calculate, as it takes time to see whether a client will continue to return. For this reason, retention has a grace period of 8 weeks. These clients would not have had time to complete 8 sessions, and so are excluded from the retention calculation. Visit the Retention Report to view different session-levels for retention.

## Compliance Metrics

### Outstanding Notes (Total)
The total number of sessions that have overdue notes, dating back to the earliest data available. You have the option to see overdue notes from a more specific or recent timeframe in the "Key Metrics" section.

### Outstanding Notes (Time Period)
The total number of sessions that have overdue notes for a specific time period based on the note completion deadline defined by your practice. Visit Settings to check your notes deadline.
