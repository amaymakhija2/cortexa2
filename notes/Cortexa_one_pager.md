# Cortexa

## Executive Summary

**Cortexa is the operating layer for independent healthcare practices.**
Today, therapists and small practice owners juggle disconnected tools for EHR, accounting, payroll, and marketing, none of which talk to each other. Cortexa integrates those systems, cleans and connects the data, and automates the workflows that follow, from reconciliation and payroll to marketing and compliance all without replacing the existing stack.

Starting in psychotherapy, Cortexa delivers enterprise-grade efficiency to independent practices, reducing operating drag by up to 40%. Once proven, we expand playbook-by-playbook into adjacent sectors like physical therapy, dental, and veterinary care.

Our mission: build a sector-deep orchestration platform that runs the business end-to-end, turning fragmented operations into measurable growth one vertical at a time.

## Problem

Independent practices do not have a single operating layer. Data sits in separate EHR, accounting, payroll, marketing, and RCM systems, and none of them run the business end to end. EHRs are walled gardens or dated and they stop at billing. Finance and HR live in different tools, so reconciliation breaks and reports conflict. Without a common model there is no reliable view of performance and no closed loop way to act. Owners feel this as slow cash, inconsistent month end, and hours lost to manual work. Switching core systems rarely helps and often costs about two months of revenue once migration and change management are included. The result is a durable status quo where MSME practices operate well below enterprise efficiency. In practical terms, independents carry a 30 to 45 percent operating drag versus enterprise peers.

## How things work now

Owners and senior providers handle the business on top of patient care. They are clinicians, not operators. Most work is manual (error prone) across about six tools for reports, reconciliation, claims management, payroll, and marketing. There is no shared data model, no benchmarks, and no work queue. Operations stay reactive and growth stalls.

## Vision

Build a sector-deep operating system that runs the business on the stack you already have. Cortexa integrates across the tools, becomes the command and control surface, and executes work so owners do not. Start with psychotherapy, then expand sector by sector using playbooks, benchmarks, and a vetted partner network. The goal is Business in Your Box: one operating layer that manages the end-to-end lifecycle without migrations and with measurable outcomes.

## What Cortexa is

An orchestration layer that sits on top of the tools you already use. It connects to the main systems in a sector, builds a clean data layer, and, more importantly, runs the actions that follow. It becomes the place where the practice actually operates. We focus on one sector at a time, which lets us encode best practices, the right benchmarks, and a vetted partner network for that specific sector.

## Why this approach

Operators do not want to buy more tools; they want problems resolved. Cortexa abstracts tool choices and wires the stack for them. Most importantly, there is no migration. We sit on top of the current stack, show value quickly, and avoid the revenue hit that comes with system switches.

## Who we serve

Start with solo therapists and owners with three to five locations. An expansion opportunity is private equity platforms in therapy and adjacent sectors. They must drive operational lift inside a tight four to five year window, which got tighter with higher rates. They manage diverse practices that all use different tools, and they do not have the staff to standardize and optimize each site.

## Proof so far

Thirty plus interviews with private practices across the country. Their top issues are clear:

- visibility into the business
- revenue growth through marketing
- efficiencies from connecting EHR, payroll, and accounting.

We have also had conversations with senior leadership at Mission Pet Health, a large veterinary PE platform capitalized by Silver Lake and Shore Capital, with about 840 practices. One of their biggest costs is a large account management team that has to manage each practice one by one. Benchmarking and optimization are heavy and under automated. Cortexa directly addresses that kind of work.

In addition, this thesis has been verified through multiple cross-sector experts, including PE operators in behavioral health, Vet, PT, and HHA (home health agencies).

## Go to market

This will not be trivial. We will follow a deliberate playbook to acquire the first 100 practices and it will require significant outreach along with targeted ad strategies, leveraging our B2C expertise. We will A/B test across channels over the next few months to find the best CAC. 

Acquisition will be founder driven, with my co founder and I personally doing onboarding. Past the first 50, we will have a repeatable playbook and will aim to unlock PE distribution. There is a large opportunity with regional rollups and multi-practice owners that is consistently missed.

## Monetization

Subscription by module, priced by complexity and number of locations. Optional optimization fee tied to EBITDA improvement where the buyer is PE-backed. ARPU is high when we tie fees to measured operational lift.

## Commercial snapshot

- We target mid-sized and growing psychotherapy practices (averaging 13 clinicians). Across payroll, HR, insights, consultations tracking, marketing, and accounting we estimate max CV of $21 K per year (≈ 1.5 % of monthly revenue for the average practice). For context, comparable practices already spend more than this on marketing and accounting vendors alone, often with lower transparency and no integrated workflow.
- There are roughly 73 K therapy practices in the U.S. (across Mental Health Practices and Substance Abuse Centers). At a maximum CV, the TAM reaches $1.5 B. We will begin with the mid-sized segment (5-19 clinicians, around 14 K practices) representing an entry-segment TAM of ~$288 M.
- Using a defensive ARPU of $7.6 K per year (≈ 40 % of max CV), our SAM is approximately $106 M within psychotherapy. At that same ARPU, we reach $20 M in ARR with about 2.6 K practices. This excludes PE contracts and upsell to higher value modules.

## TAM and cross sector expansion

- Starting sector: Psychotherapy. The broader U.S. psychotherapy market includes ~73 K independent practices, with 14 K mid-sized practices (5-19 clinicians) as our initial focus. At a $21 K maximum CV, we estimate TAM of $288 M annually.
- Next sectors: Outpatient physical therapy, dental, veterinary, ophthalmology, and home health.
- Overlap: About 60 percent of workflows and modules carry over across these sectors. This lowers integration and training cost and shortens time to value in each new sector.
- Reuse: The normalized data model, benchmark library, and partner network extend with limited net new work per sector.
- Expansion method: For each new sector we integrate sector-specific tools, train modules on sector workflows and requirements, hire a sector lead with deep experience, run pilots with about 30 practices, and adjust the GTM to the sector’s acquisition paths.
- Module footprint: Psychotherapy requires roughly 27 modules. Most carry forward or only need tuning in adjacent sectors.

## Retention and moat

Cortexa runs day-to-day operations, so it is not easily replaced. Sector depth increases with every practice onboarded. Benchmarks get better. The vetted partner network is built into workflows. As we add modules and new sectors, the value compounds and switching costs rise.

**What compounds and why it blocks copycats**

- Data assets: A normalized psychotherapy operations schema with validated mappings across the top EHR, payroll, and accounting systems.
- Benchmarks: Sector benchmarks by payer mix, geography, clinician type, and modality that guide actions.
- Execution network: Certified partners with SLAs, scored by outcome, embedded into workflows with accountability.
- Switching costs: Owned task history, playbooks, and automations that sit in the daily run of show. Replacing Cortexa requires rebuilding operations, not just buying a tool.

## Next steps

Ship psychotherapy v1 with core integrations and the workflows above. Run pilots and publish the operational results. Stand up lighthouse PE accounts. Prepare the next vertical with integrations, a sector lead, and a 30 practice pilot.
