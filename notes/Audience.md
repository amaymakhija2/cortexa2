# Target Audience

**Psychotherapy practice owners and clinical directors** at practices with 5+ clinicians.

## User Types

| Type | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Practice Owner | Financials + everything else (full picture) |
| Clinical Director | Clinical quality, staff - less concerned with financials |

Same use cases, different emphasis.

## Who They Are

- **Poor at understanding data** - graphs and complex visualizations don't work for them
- **Struggle with technology** - need hand-holding, avoid learning new tools
- **Hate admin work** - want it automated or extremely simplified
- **Time-starved** - won't invest time to learn; it needs to just work

## Current State (Pain Points)

**Tools they use today:**
- Excel/spreadsheets for admin work (manual, error-prone, time-consuming)
- EHR built-in reports (very limited, hard to interpret)
- Often flying blind with no formal tracking

**Current behavior:**
- Only check data monthly (if at all) due to tool limitations
- Would check more frequently if a simple system existed
- Largely operating on gut feeling

## What They Care About

1. **Analytics** - They don't know anything about their business
   - Must be action/takeaway oriented
   - NOT data overload - tell them what to do, not just show numbers

2. **Consultations / Lead Gen CRM** - Nothing exists to track this today
   - New client pipeline is a black box

3. **Staff Management** - Hiring, retention, burnout
   - Clinician health directly affects the business

## Design Principles

- **Spoon-feed everything** - surface insights, don't make them search
- **Bold, large text** - they should know exactly where to look
- **Clean UI** - uncluttered, minimal cognitive load
- **No complex charts** - if you need a chart, make it dead simple
- **Action-oriented** - every screen should answer "so what do I do?"
- **Zero learning curve** - if they have to figure it out, they won't use it
