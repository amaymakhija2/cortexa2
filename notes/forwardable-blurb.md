# Cortexa Forwardable Email Blurb

Use these blurbs when asking connections to forward/introduce you to group therapy practice owners.

---

## Version A: Product-First (Recommended for Forwards)

Best when a connection is forwarding to a peer. The forwarder adds context like "Hey, thought of you. This might help with the reporting headaches you mentioned." Then the blurb explains what it is.

### Long

**Cortexa is the one place to run your group therapy practice.** It connects to your EHR, pulls everything together, and shows you what's working, what needs attention, and where you can grow. No spreadsheets. No confusing reports. Just clear answers in plain English, updated daily.

Most practice owners we talk to are stuck piecing together spreadsheets and EHR reports just to answer basic questions: Are we actually making money? Which clinicians are struggling? Why are clients leaving? They're guessing at what's wrong and making decisions on gut feel. Cortexa fixes that.

We're building toward a future where all the things that pull you away from clinical work (consultations, payroll, accounting, marketing) live in one place, so you can spend less time on admin and more time on what matters.

**A bit about me:**
I'm Amay. I started Cortexa after my wife and I built Gaya Therapy, NY's first South Asian focused psychotherapy practice. That experience showed me how hard it is to actually know what's going on in your practice without drowning in admin. My vision with Cortexa is to help group practices thrive by giving owners clarity, freeing up time for clinical work, and reducing the burnout that comes from juggling too many systems.

## Version B: Problem-First (Cold Outreach / Ads)

Best for direct cold outreach, LinkedIn posts, or ads where you need to hook them with the problem first.

### Long

If you run a group therapy practice, you probably spend hours every month digging through spreadsheets and EHR reports trying to answer basic questions: Are we actually making money? Which clinicians are struggling? Why are clients leaving?

Most practice owners never get clear answers. They piece together data from three different systems, guess at what's going wrong, and make decisions based on gut feel. Meanwhile, the admin piles up, the clinical work suffers, and burnout sets in.

## When to Use Which

| Version | Use Case |

## Key Principles Applied

- **Audience-appropriate language**: "The one place to run your practice" (simple, aspirational, captures full vision)
- **Balanced framing**: "What's working, what needs attention, where you can grow" (not just negative)
- **Specificity**: "hours every month," "three different systems"
- **Vision without feature-dumping**: Parenthetical list hints at scope without overwhelming
- **Founder story**: Personal credibility with Gaya Therapy background
- **Soft CTA**: "Worth a conversation if this resonates" (low pressure for forwards)
